	Open `displaySat.pde' with Processing.
	
	If loading new data, set `FIRST_RUN' flag to `1'; otherwise set to `0' for subsequent runs.
	
	If FIRST_RUN == 1, then set `simulationPath' to data output directory from Molecular Simulation.
	
	Otherwise, set `localTSVData' to import condensed `*.tsv' datapoints.
	
Run:
	
	Execute the sketch from the Processing IDE.
	
	Hover metric name with mouse to select data points.  
	Click metric name to save *.pdf output.
	Hover and scroll on each axis to scale points.
